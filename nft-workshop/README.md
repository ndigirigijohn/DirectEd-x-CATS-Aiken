# NFT Workshop

This folder hosts the CLI scaffolding that accompanies:

- **Module M002** – reuse the scripts while following the mock-transaction exercises.
- **Module M006** – pair it with the minting-policy lessons once you move into NFT collection work.

All setup instructions and walkthroughs now live in `modules/m006/notes/`. Start there for context, then clone or run this project when you need a practical sandbox.
