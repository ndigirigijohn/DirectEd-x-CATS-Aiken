# Vesting Example

This directory combines:

- `vesting-sc/` – the Aiken validators explored in **Module M005** (state machines) and revisited in **Module M007** (blueprints & DApps).
- `vesting-dapp/` – a Next.js front-end that consumes the compiled blueprint when you reach the integration exercises.

Implementation details, deployment notes, and walkthroughs now live in the module materials (`modules/m005/*` and `modules/m007/*`). Use those guides first, then dip into this project when you want a full-stack reference.
